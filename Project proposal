##The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.

  The main idea of my project is to create a program interface that allows the user to keep track of their income and expenses for their personal finance. This program will keep track of all cashflows and eliminate unnecessary subscriptions based on the users budget goals based on user input priorities. From there the user can track their progress.  People spend so much money on hiring a finacial advisior to keep track of their financial situation, but really dont know whats going on behind the scenes. The goal of this app would be to allow people to be in the loop of their finacials within in the reach of their pocket. Instead of creating excel sheets and visiting many different sites to get all this information, a platform where people can see their finances and even manage their money. Imagine that you have rent due along with several other subscriptions and money is getting tight, this app could cancel you least favorite subscriptions to free up liquidity (This would be a preset ordered list). 

##Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

- learn to create an interactive program 
- use API's for real life problems 
- create an automated system to execute tasks based on constraints without manual input 

##Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.

1. create a example database of a person's finances (expenses, income, and budget goals) 
2. create list values in vs code for the expenses, income, and emergancy fund
3. create budget rules (saving goals, spending goals, cancel unused subscriptions to budget expenses) 
4. create interface to displace account summary, expenses, and year to date account history

##Project Schedule: You have roughly 4-5 weeks to complete the project. Create a general timeline. Depending on your project, this could be a detailed schedule or just an overview. As the project progresses, youâ€™ll likely need to revise this schedule.

week 1 create groups 
week 2 come up with ideas for project 
week 3
- research similar interfaces (empower, robinhood, banks) 
- draw out a rough draft of interface 
- create databases to use in code 
week 4 
- create code for programs functions (rules) 
- create visualizations for the data (lists, graphs) 
- 
week 5 
- create website interface 
- finalize code and user interface 

##Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.

- I dont have a teammate 

##Risks and Limitations: What do you think is the biggest risk to the success of your project?

- Access to proper data 
- functionality of the programs rules 
- problems with interface design 

##Additional Course Content: Are there any course topics or content you think would be helpful for your project?

- Lists
- vairbles, expressions & statements
- functions 
- conditionals
- strings?
- API's
- Debugging
- Tuples
- Flasks
- imputs
