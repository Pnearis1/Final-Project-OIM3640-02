Project Ideas: 
1. pocket financial manager
  - an app that shows saving, checkings accounts
  - displays investing portfolio with live prices and quantity of shares invested in portfolio
  - Keeps track of subscriptions
     - (later on) cancels least prioritized subscription
  - user is able to input reoccuring costs (rent, uitilities, insurance, groceries, gym) 
  - Lets user decide allocation percent to 4 facets of spending (expenses, investing, savings, free lance spending)
  -  maybe incorperate an emergency fund in the app
  -  limiting total spending and gradually decreasing over time by exposing inefficiences 
Purpose: People spend so much money on hiring a finacial advisior to keep track of their financial situation, but really dont know whats going on behind the scenes. The goal of this app would be to allow people to be in the loop of their finacials within in the reach of their pocket. Instead of creating excel sheets and visiting many different sites to get all this information, a platform where people can see their finances and even manage their money. Imagine that you have rent due along with several other subscriptions and money is getting tight, this app could cancel you least favorite subscriptions to free up liquidity (This would be a preset ordered list). 

2. Simplified version^^^
- an app that shows savings, checkings, and investing accounts
- asks the user to create presets for speanding/savig/invetsing goals
- Keep strack of all expense from the bank accounts (subscriptions, rent, utilities, grocieries, etc.)
- add an emergancy fund?
- 
- sends reminders to user about sepending habits and where they are with their daily, weekly, monthy, yearly 
- Creates a monthly report on spending habits, areas of useless spending, savings/losses (depending on user performance), projected savings?

3. Price comparison
- An app the compares items in different stores showcased on one app.
- the idea is that you search up for a general item (gas, tires? drycleaning? Phones? eye wear?) and it displays a map with the store name and the price for that item and compares location and price
- the program retreives real time prices that can be compared for users
Purpose: The idea for this app is to find a way to maximize savings for users on every day commoditites such as gas. The problem people face is that they get gas at one place and pass another with cheaper prices and cannot do much about it. Hvaing an app that displays all gas stations in the area with their repective prices for each fuel type can save people money and time. Also with the onboarding
