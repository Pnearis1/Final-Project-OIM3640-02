## Project Idea: 


### Purpose
Purpose: People spend so much money on hiring a finacial advisior to keep track of their financial situation, but really dont know whats going on behind the scenes. The goal of this app would be to allow people to be in the loop of their finacials within in the reach of their pocket. Instead of creating excel sheets and visiting many different sites to get all this information, a platform where people can see their finances and even manage their money. Imagine that you have rent due along with several other subscriptions and money is getting tight, this app could cancel you least favorite subscriptions to free up liquidity (This would be a preset ordered list). Or you would like to set a spending limit so that you can save moeny more effectivly. Or you income after expenses gets allocated to accounts to save up for emergecies or retirement. This app will do it all. 

## User Instructions 
### acc_sum.html
This HTML code represents a finance dashboard designed to display a summary of a user's monthly financial data using Bootstrap for styling. The page is structured into three main sections, each encapsulated in a Bootstrap card. The first section, titled "Income," presents three pieces of data: the user's total monthly income, total monthly expenses, and the remaining income after expenses. These values are inserted dynamically using templating syntax (such as {{ monthly_income }}), indicating that the HTML is intended to be rendered by a server-side templating engine, possibly Flask or Django.

The second and third sections focus on income allocation and spending control. The "Income Allocation" card displays how the remaining income is divided among retirement, emergency, and liquidity funds. The "Spending Limit" card compares monthly expenses to a predefined spending limit and displays a status message accordingly. The status uses conditional logic to show whether the user is over, at, or within the spending limit, with appropriate Bootstrap color classes for visual cues—red for over, yellow for at, and green for within the limit. Overall, the page offers a clear and visually organized overview of a user's financial health for the month.
### expense.html
This HTML code is designed for displaying bank account expenses by category in a user-friendly format using Bootstrap. The page is divided into cards that represent different expense categories, and each card displays a table with a list of expenses within that category. The layout is responsive and structured, providing a clear breakdown of expenses, including the name of each expense, its amount, the date it was last paid, and the date of the next payment. If there are no expenses for a particular category, a message stating "No expenses recorded in this category" is shown, and if there are no categories at all, a message "No categories or expenses available" appears in the center.

The page utilizes templating syntax to populate the content. It uses for loops to iterate over categories and the expenses within them. Each category is presented in its own card with a header showing the category name in title case. If there are expenses in the category, they are displayed in a table with columns for expense name, amount (formatted as a currency), last paid date, and next due date. The data is  inserted into the HTML using templating filters like {{ expense.amount | floatformat:2 }} and {{ expense.next_due | default('N/A') }}, which ensures proper formatting and defaults when necessary. This template makes it easy for users to track and manage their bank-related expenses.
### app.py
This Flask application is designed to display a list of bank expenses categorized by type, such as "Housing + utilities", "Health", "Subscriptions", and "Lifestyle". The core of the application is the expenses list, which contains multiple expense entries, each with details like the expense name, amount, category, and due dates. The exp_index function processes this data by categorizing each expense into predefined categories and stores them in a dictionary called categories. This dictionary is then passed to an HTML template (expense.html) using the render_template function, allowing the data to be dynamically displayed on a web page.

When users navigate to the /Expenses URL, the application renders the expense.html template, which organizes and shows the expenses grouped by category. Each category is displayed in its own card, and within each card, a table lists the associated expenses with details like the expense name, amount, last paid date, and next payment due date. The app runs in Flask’s debug mode, which makes it easier for developers to troubleshoot and test during development. This setup allows users to have an interactive and categorized view of their expenses, helping them better manage their finances.
### income_allocation.py
This Python program functions as a personal budgeting assistant that helps users allocate their remaining income after expenses into key financial categories: retirement, emergency savings, and liquidity (cash on hand). When the user runs the program, they are first asked to input their monthly income and total essential expenses. The code then calculates how much money is left over after expenses. With that remaining balance, the user is prompted to enter how they’d like to split it—by percentage—among the three savings categories. The program validates that the percentages add up to exactly 100% and then calculates the dollar amount for each allocation, displaying a summary of how the leftover income is distributed.

Additionally, the program includes a function (alert_spending_limit) that checks whether the user's current spending is close to, at, or above a predefined spending limit. Although this function isn’t directly used in the main flow, it can be called separately to provide real-time feedback on financial habits. Overall, this script combines income management and basic financial planning by enforcing disciplined saving while remaining user-customizable. It’s designed to empower users to stay on top of their finances without complex tools or spreadsheets.
### spending_limit.py
This Python script acts as a spending limit tracker that helps users manage their personal budgets by monitoring their monthly expenses against a self-defined limit. When the program is run, the user is first prompted to input a valid monthly spending limit. The program ensures that the input is a positive number and then moves into expense tracking mode. The user is repeatedly asked to input individual expense amounts, which are added to a cumulative total. After each expense entry, the program compares the total spent so far to the original spending limit and provides real-time alerts when the user has reached 80% of their budget, hit the limit exactly, or gone over it. These alerts aim to give users clear, actionable feedback on their spending behavior.

Once the user is finished entering expenses (by typing 0), the program exits the loop and prints a final summary that includes the total amount spent and how much money is left from the spending limit—or how much the user exceeded it by. The program also includes safeguards against invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric entries, making it user-friendly and robust. Overall, this script serves as a practical tool for individuals looking to stick to a budget and gain better control over their daily or monthly spending habits without needing external software or complex tools.
### subscription_mgt.py 
This Python program is a Smart Subscription Manager that helps users manage their monthly subscription expenses based on their income and essential living costs. The user inputs their monthly income and total essential expenses (like rent, groceries, etc.). The program calculates how much money remains after these essentials. Then, it compares the leftover money to the total cost of all active subscriptions. If the user has enough leftover income to afford all subscriptions, the program confirms that everything can be kept. Otherwise, it begins canceling subscriptions one by one, starting with the lowest-priority ones (as defined by their order in the list), until the remaining balance can cover the rest.

The main benefit of this tool is automated budgeting support. It prevents users from unknowingly overspending on non-essential services like streaming platforms and apps by automatically prioritizing what's more valuable (like the gym or phone storage) and removing lower-priority subscriptions (like Paramount+ or HBO Max) if needed. At the end, the program clearly shows the user which subscriptions are kept and which were canceled, and even shows the total amount saved—giving them a quick financial summary. This can empower users to manage their finances more wisely without needing a financial advisor or manually tracking every subscription.

## issues
While building this program, I encountered several challenges that slowed down development and forced me to rethink my approach. One of the main issues was designing a user interface that felt clean and intuitive—early versions were cluttered or lacked proper structure, making the experience confusing for users. I also struggled with importing Excel files correctly, especially when trying to parse and extract specific financial data into usable formats. Managing dependencies like `pandas` and making sure file paths worked consistently across different machines added to the frustration. Additionally, organizing the code so that all the parts—like budgeting logic, alerts, and visualizations—worked together cohesively was more difficult than expected. I had to refactor several times to ensure functions communicated properly and didn’t interfere with each other, which was a great learning experience in building scalable, modular code.

## What I would like to change/include further on 
In the future, I would like to significantly enhance this program by developing a cleaner and more intuitive user interface. Right now, the functionality is mostly console-based, which works but lacks visual appeal and ease of use. A clean, responsive web interface or even a mobile-friendly app would help users interact with their financial data more efficiently. With clearly labeled sections, dropdown inputs, and visual feedback, users could navigate the budgeting and tracking features without any confusion. Features like color-coded alerts, category filters, and guided input prompts would make the experience far more user-friendly and visually engaging.

Additionally, I’d love to integrate an investing dashboard where users can view and track their stock portfolio. This could include live stock price updates, portfolio value summaries, and performance trends over time. By connecting the app to public APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage, users could monitor their investments in real-time and see how their overall financial health is influenced not just by spending, but also by asset growth. Including this component would turn the program into a more holistic personal finance manager, giving users insight into both their cash flow and long-term wealth building.

On the data visualization side, I want to implement a pie chart that dynamically shows the breakdown of monthly expenses, retirement contributions, emergency savings, and remaining liquidity. This would give users a visual representation of where their money is going at a glance. Alongside this, I envision a line chart that tracks spending trends over time, showing how their expenses decrease or shift based on changes in spending habits. By visualizing progress, users would feel more empowered and motivated to stay within budget and make smarter financial choices. These visual features would elevate the program from a utility tool into an interactive, insight-driven platform for personal financial growth.
